#Chairing #Definition 
The ***Rayleigh Quotient*** states that, for a symmetric matrix $M^{n\times n}$ and a non-zero vector $v^n$, we can make a function $R(M,v)$ that measures the "scaled energy" of $v$ relative to $M$ and is defined as:
$$
R(M,v) = \frac{v^TMv}{v^tv}
$$
It also states we can bound the Quotient as:
$$
\lambda_{\text{min}}(M) \leq R(M,v) \leq \lambda_{\text{max}}(M), \text{ } \forall v\neq_{0}
$$
