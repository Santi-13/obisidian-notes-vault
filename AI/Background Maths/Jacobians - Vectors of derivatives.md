When you have a single function of many variables:
$$
f(x_{1},x_{2},x_{3},\dots)
$$
The Jacobian of that function can be described as a vector of the partial derivatives of the function.
$$
J=\left[ \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_{1}}, \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_{2}},\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_{3}},\dots\right]
$$
By convention, we write this as a row vector, instead of a column vector.
