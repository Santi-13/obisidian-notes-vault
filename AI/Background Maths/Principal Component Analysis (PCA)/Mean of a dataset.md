As discussed in the course's [[Introduction]], we often need to use some special properties to describe and discuss **datasets**, as just showing the full set is often not very useful.

In the case of the ***mean*** or ***expected value*** of the **dataset**, it describes the *average* data point. For a dataset $D$:
$$
D=\{ x_{1},\dots,x_{n} \}
$$
Then the ***expected value*** is:
$$
\text{E}[D] = \frac{1}{n}\sum^n_{n=1}x_{n}
$$
A key aspect of the ***mean*** is that it doesn't have to be part of the dataset itself.
