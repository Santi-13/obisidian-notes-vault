Let's analyze the following datasets, as well as their ***[[Mean of a Dataset|expected value]]***.

```desmos-graph
left=-4; right=14;
top=2; bottom=0;
---
f(x)=1
(-1,1)|red
(3,1)|red
(7,1)|red
(1,1)|blue
(2,1)|blue
(4,1)|blue
(5,1)|blue
```
Where:
$$
D_{1}=\{ 1,2,4,5 \}, \text{E}[D_{1}]=3
$$
$$
D_{2}=\{ -1,3,7 \}, \text{E}[D_{2}]=3
$$
