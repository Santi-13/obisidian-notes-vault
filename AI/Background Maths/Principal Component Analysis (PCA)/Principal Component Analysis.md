***Principal Component Analysis (PCA)*** is a mathematical tool to reduce the dimensionality of high dimensional data (i.e The multiple factors of house prices; or even a 640x480 pixels image, where every pixel corresponds to three dimensions).

The reason we do this is because working with high dimensional *data* is difficult. It is hard to **analyze**, **interpretation** is difficult, **visualization** is nearly impossible and **storage** can be quite expensive.

Not that all is bad. For example, high dimensional data is often **over-complete**, that is, often times many dimensions are redundant and can be explained by a combination of other dimensions.
