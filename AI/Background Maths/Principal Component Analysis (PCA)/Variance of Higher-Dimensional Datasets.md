The intuitive definition of the ***[[Variance of 1D Datasets|Variance]]*** we explored doesn't really work in high dimensions, and *squaring* vectors is not really define.

In the example of a 2d dataset, we may be able to compute the ***variance*** of each dimension, but we may also be interested in the relationship between this variables. This is where the concept of a ***covariance*** between these components comes into play.
