When we have a multi-variable function, such as $f(x,y,z)$, but the variables themselves are a function of some other variable $t$. If we want to get the derivative of $f$ with respect to $t$, which is simply the sum of the chains relating $f$ to $t$ through each variable. This is called the ***Total Derivative***. For example:
$$
f(x,y,z)=\sin(x)
$$
