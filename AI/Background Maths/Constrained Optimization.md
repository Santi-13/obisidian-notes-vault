***Constrained optimization*** refers to finding the *minima* or *maxima* of a function along a constrained *path*. A **contour map** is a graphical representation of a three-dimensional surface on a two-dimensional plane. It uses **contour lines** to connect points of equal value, such as elevation or temperature.

A french mathematician named **Lagrange** noticed that when the **contours** just *touch* the *path*, then you'll have found the *maximum* or *minimum* point.
