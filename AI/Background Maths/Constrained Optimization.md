***Constrained optimization*** refers to finding the *minima* or *maxima* of a function along a constrained *path*. A **contour map** is a graphical representation of a three-dimensional surface on a two-dimensional plane. It uses **contour lines** to connect points of equal value, such as elevation or temperature. For the function $f(x,y) = x^2
