Euclid's life was not very well documented, we now he probably studied in Plato's *Academy* in Athens sometime after his death and that he took geometry very seriously. He brought his knowledge to Alexandria, where he wrote *Elements*, one of the most influential mathematical books of the time. 

##### *Euclid's Greatest Common Measure*
Book *X* of Euclid's *Elements* contained a concise treatment of incommensurable quantities:

> **Proposition 2.** If, when the less of two unequal magnitudes is continually substracted in turn from the greater, that which is left never measures the one before it, then the two magnitudes are incommensurable.
