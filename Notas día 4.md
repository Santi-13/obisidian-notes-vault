Perturbations are **internal**, disturbances are **external** and noise is intrinsic of the sensors

Where $\Psi(q_{a},q_{b},)$ represents the non-modelled sections of the robot, while $\Psi(,,t)$ represents the effect of all external perturbations. The admissible class of perturbations/uncertainties:

$$
\Psi=\{\psi :\mathrm{R^n} * \mathrm{R^n} * \mathrm{R^+} \}
$$
