Similar to what we learned about the ***[[Newton-Raphson Method & Gradient Descent]]***, we can try something called ***Constrained Optimization***, which basically means finding the minima or maximum of a function *constrained* by another equation. For example, for the function $f(x)$ constrained by $g(x)$:
$$
f(x)=\exp\left( -\frac{2x^2+y^2-xy}{2} \right)
$$
